# solinca-notification-portal-fe

Considering that there are only a few spots available, it is rare to be able to book online group classes at Solinca’s clubs using the mobile app or at marqueoseutreino.solinca.pt. This portal was developed to allow the user to configure his/her favorite classes for today and tomorrow and to be notified by e-mail or WhatsApp when a spot is available for these classes. This way, there is no need to frequently access Solinca’s app/site to check if some spots emerged for the classes that the user intends to book."
